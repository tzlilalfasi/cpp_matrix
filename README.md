# cpp_matrix

The program implements a mathematical matrix by two defferent data structures. 
The first data structure is implemented as "Matrix" which stores the matrix data as array of double arrays.
The second data structure is implemented as "SMatrix" which stores the matrix data as two arrays, one is for the columns and one is for the rows.
These arrays holds pointers to linked lists, and contains only numbers that is not zero. that way, the data structure is efficient.
